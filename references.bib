abstract = {Recently, Internet service providers (ISPs) have gained increased flexibility in how they configure their in-ground optical fiber into an IP network. This greater control has been made possible by improvements in optical switching technology, along with advances in software control. Traditionally, at network design time, each IP link was assigned a fixed optical path and bandwidth. Now modern colorless and directionless reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (CD ROADMs) allow a remote controller to remap the IP topology to the optical underlay on the fly. Consequently, ISPs face new opportunities and challenges in the design and operation of their backbone networks \[IEEE Commun. Mag.54, 129 (2016)ICOMD90163-680410.1109/MCOM.2016.7588281; presentation at the International Conference on Computing, Networking, and Communications, 2017; J. Opt. Commun. Netw.10, D52 (2018)JOCNBB1943-062010.1364/JOCN.10.000D52; Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exposition (2018), paper Tu3H.2\]. Specifically, ISPs must determine how best to design their networks to take advantage of new capabilities; they need an automated way to generate the least expensive network design that still delivers all offered traffic, even in the presence of equipment failures. This problem is difficult because of the physical constraints governing the placement of optical regenerators, a piece of optical equipment necessary to maintain an optical signal over long stretches of fiber. As a solution, we present an integer linear program (ILP) that does three specific things: It solves the equipment placement problem in network design; determines the optimal mapping of IP links to the optical infrastructure for any given failure scenario; and determines how best to route the offered traffic over the IP topology. To scale to larger networks, we also describe an efficient heuristic that finds nearly optimal network designs in a fraction of the time. Further, in our experiments our ILP offers cost savings of up to 29\% compared to traditional network design techniques.},

The algorithm assigns bundles to laser-photodetector edges as they arrive online with the goal of minimizing the bundle/flow completion times over all bundles in the system. We compare the performance of the proposed stable-matching algorithm to the optimal performance of a more powerful hindsight optimal algorithm that is aware of all the bundles arriving in the system and can operate offline. We also give an integer linear programming formulation for the problem of maximizing instantaneous throughput.},

	Abstract = {Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome
    the ossification of today's Internet as if facilitates innovation
    also in the network core and as it promises a more efficient
    use of the given resources and infrastructure. Virtual networks
    (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network: multiple
    VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on
    completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the
    main challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission
    control and embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks
    (e.g., for a video conference) can be hard to predict, and once the
    request is accepted, the specification / QoS guarantees must be
    ensured throughout the VNet�s lifetime. This requires an admission
    control algorithm which only selects high-benefit VNets in times
    of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes the
    VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be
    embedded as well is maximized.
    This paper describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet
    embedding problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the
    future VNet requests but whose performance is competitive to an
    optimal offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the request
    sequence in advance: the so-called competitive ratio is, loosely
    speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the resources. Our algorithm
    is generic in the sense that it supports multiple traffic models,
    multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform benefits
    and durations of VNet requests. Concretely, the routing models
    considered in this paper include: multipaths, single paths, and tree
    routing. For modeling traffic, we study the customer-pipe model, the
    hose model, and a new traffic model, called {\it aggregate ingress
    model}, that is well suited for modeling multicasts and multi-party
    video conferences.},

    and infeasibility of inferring the network topology given traceroute
    data from a worst-case perspective, i.e., without any probabilistic
    assumptions on, e.g., the nodes' degree distribution. We attend to
    a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose
    two fundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the
    traceroute data: (1) each trace corresponds to a real path in the
    network, and (2) the routing paths are at most a factor 1/$\alpha$
    off the shortest paths, for some parameter $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1]. In
    contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of
    the set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that
    a large number of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic,
    as long as the networks have a similar structure. We hence seek
    to characterize the set of topologies inferred with our axioms.
    We introduce the notion of star graphs whose colorings capture
    the differences among inferred topologies; it also allows us to
    construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,
    inferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important
    aspects, such as the nodes' distances or the number of triangles.
    These negative results are complemented by a discussion of a
    scenario where the trace set is best possible, i.e., ''complete''. It
    turns out that while some properties such as the node degrees are
    still hard to measure, a complete trace set can help to determine
    global properties such as the connectivity.")"},

    system (e.g., a gaming application) where network virtualization
    is used to support thin client applications for mobile devices to
    improve their QoS. To deal with the dynamics of both the mobile

    the access pattern in advance.

	Abstract = {The efficient coordination of medium access is arguably
    one of the most relevant applications of distributed computing.
    Recently, progress has been made in the design of robust medium
    access (MAC) protocols that guarantee a competitive throughput
    against a powerful jammer which can block the medium an arbitrary
    constant fraction (1-$\epsilon$) of the time. These MAC protocols
    exploit the remaining $\epsilon$-fraction optimally in the sense
    that a significant part is used for successful transmissions.
    However, so far these throughput guarantees only hold for rather
    simplistic interference models such as Unit Disk Graphs. This paper
    reports on our first insights on the design of a robust medium
    access protocol SinrMac for the more realistic physical interference
    model which takes into account the signal to interference plus noise
    ratio (SINR) at the receiver. This model is more difficult, as
    there is no longer an objective distinction of idling and busy time
    periods which can be used to dynamically adjust the wireless nodes'
    backoff periods. We discuss an approach that introduces individual
    ``idle/busy thresholds'' which are adapted dynamically and, unlike
    the multiplicative backoff periods, in an {\it additive} manner. We
    find that a reasonable convergence speed (and throughput) can be
    achieved if there exists some meaningful upper bound $\tau$
    on the noise level in the network; surprisingly, however, our first
    simulation results indicate that adaptive changes of the idly/busy
    thresholds do not yield a better throughput than static thresholds
    set to $\tau$.},

	Abstract = {This article reports on the results of our measurement
    study of the Kad network. Although several fully decentralized
    peer-to-peer systems have been proposed in the literature, most
    existing systems still employ a centralized architecture. The Kad
    network is a notable exception. Since the demise of the Overnet
    network, the Kad network has become the most popular peer-to-peer
    system based on a distributed hash table. It is likely that its user
    base will continue to grow in numbers over the next few years due to
    the system's scalability and reliability.
    The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we compare the
    two networks accessed by eMule: the centralized paradigm of the
    eDonkey network and the structured, distributed approach pursued
    by the Kad network. We re-engineer the eDonkey server software
    and integrate two modified servers into the eDonkey network in
    order to monitor traffic. Additionally, we implement a Kad client
    exploiting a design weakness to spy on the traffic at arbitrary
    locations in the ID space. The collected data provides insights
    into the spacial and temporal distributions of the peers' activity.
    Moreover, it allows us to study the searched content. The article
    also discusses problems related to the collection of such data sets
    and investigates techniques to verify the representativeness of the
    measured data.
    Second, this article shows that today's Kad network can be attacked
    in several ways. Our simple attacks could be used either to hamper
    the correct functioning of the network itself, to censor content, or
    to harm other entities in the Internet not participating in the Kad
    network, such as ordinary web servers. While there are heuristics to
    improve the robustness of Kad, we believe that the attacks cannot be
    thwarted easily in a fully decentralized peer-to-peer system, i.e.,
    without some kind of a centralized certification and verification
    authority. This result may be relevant in the context of the current
    debate on the design of a clean-slate network architecture for the
    Internet which is based on concepts known from the peer-to-peer
    paradigm.},

    protocol for wireless networks where nodes communicate over a
    shared medium. SELECT is very robust in two respects. First, the
    protocol is self-stabilizing in the sense that it converges to a
    correct solution from any possible initial network state (e.g.,
    where no or multiple nodes consider themselves a leader). This is
    an appealing property, especially for dynamic networks. Second, the
    described protocol is resilient against a powerful reactive jammer
    that blocks a significant fraction of all communication rounds. The
    reactive model is general and of interest beyond jamming (e.g., in
    the context of co-existing networks). The paper also reports on

    for communication networks operating over a shared medium where
    availability is imperative. Jamming attacks are often simple and
    cheap to implement. Today's jammers can perform physical carrier
    sensing in order to disrupt communication more efficiently,
    especially in a network of simple wireless devices such as
    sensor nodes, which usually operate over a single frequency (or
    a limited frequency band) and which cannot benefit from the use
    of spread spectrum or other more advanced technologies. This
    paper proposes the medium access (MAC) protocol ANTIJAM which is
    provably robust against a powerful reactive adversary who can jam
    a (1-$\varepsilon$)-portion of the time steps, where $\varepsilon$
    is an arbitrary constant. The adversary uses carrier sensing to
    make informed decisions on when it is most harmful to disrupt
    communications. Moreover, we allow the adversary to be adaptive
    and to have complete knowledge of the entire protocol history.
    Our MAC protocol is able to make efficient use of the nonjammed
    time periods and achieves a $\Theta$(1)-competitive throughput in
    this harsh scenario, if $\varepsilon$ is constant. In addition,
    ANTIJAM features a low convergence time and has excellent fairness

	Abstract = {Distributed systems are often dynamic in the sense
    that there are frequent membership changes (nodes joining and
    leaving the network), either due to regular churn or due to an
    attack. Maintaining availability and full functionality of such
    a system under continuous topological changes hence constitutes
    an important algorithmic challenge. This paper reports on some of
    our recent results on robust distributed systems. We review two
    randomized architectures that build upon the continuous-discrete
    approach by Naor and Wieder, namely the {\it SHELL network} which
    allows for fast joins and leaves and organizes more reliable (or
    stronger) nodes in a core network where their communication is
    not affected by malicious (or weak) nodes, and the {\it Chameleon
    network} whose replica placement strategy and whose intentional
    topological updates ensure resiliency against denial-of-service
    attacks, even from past insiders. To complement our investigations
    on randomized architectures, we discuss algorithms to maintain
    hypercubic networks under worstcase churn. Finally, we advocate the
    design of self-stabilizing topologies---a very appealing and still
    not well-understood notion of robustness---that converge quickly
    to a desirable structure from arbitrarily degenerated states. As
    a use case, graph linearization is examined in more detail. This

	Abstract = {Over the last years, game theory has provided insights
    into the behavior of distributed systems by modeling the players
    as utility maximizing agents. In particular, it has been shown
    that selfishness causes many systems to perform in a globally
    suboptimal fashion. Such systems are said to have a large {\it Price
    of Anarchy}. In this article, we extend this field of research by
    allowing some players to be malicious rather than selfish. We ask:
    What is the impact of malicious players on the system consisting
    of otherwise selfish players? In particular, we introduce the {\it
    Price of Malice} as a measure that captures how much the system's
    efficiency degrades in the presence of malicious players, compared
    to a purely selfish environment. As a specific example, we analyze
    the Price of Malice of a game which models the containment of the
    spread of viruses. In this game, each player or node can choose
    whether or not to install anti-virus software. Then, a virus starts
    from a random node and recursively infects all neighboring nodes
    which are not inoculated. We establish various results about this
    game. For instance, we quantify how much the presence of malicious
    players can deteriorate or--in case of highly risk-averse selfish
    players--improve the social welfare of the distributed system.},

    ad-hoc networks is interference reduction. This paper presents a
    receiver-centric interference model featuring two main advantages
    over previous work. First, it reflects the fact that interference
    occurs at the intended receiver of a message. Second, the presented
    interference measure is robust with respect to addition or removal
    of single network nodes. Regarding both of these aspects our
    model intuitively corresponds to the behavior of interference in
    reality. Based on this interference model, we show that currently

    Motivated by the observation that already one-dimensional network
    instances display the intricacy of the considered problem, we
    continue to focus on the so-called highway model. Setting out

    eventually describe an algorithm guaranteeing to achieve a {\it

	Abstract = {Peer-to-peer (p2p) systems have the potential to harness
    huge amounts of resources. Unfortunately, however, it has been shown
    that most of today's p2p networks suffer from a large fraction
    of free-riders, who consume resources without contributing much
    to the system themselves. This results in an overall performance
    degradation, and hence proper incentives are needed to encourage
    contributions. One interesting resource is bandwidth. Thereby, a
    service differentiation approach seems appropriate, where peers
    contributing higher upload bandwidths are rewarded with higher
    download bandwidths in return. Keeping track of the contribution
    of each peer in an open, decentralized environment, however, is
    a difficult task; many proposed systems are susceptible to false
    reports. Besides being prone to attacks, some solutions have a
    large communication and computation overhead, which can even be
    linear in the number of transactions---an unacceptable burden in
    practical and active systems. In this paper, we propose a reputation
    system which is robust to false reports and overcomes this scaling
    problem. Our results are promising, indicating that the mechanism
    is accurate and efficient especially when applied in systems where
    there are lots of transactions. For a more detailed technical

    nodes to gather dynamically in order to fulfill a certain task

    or packets of a multimedia data stream). As in most distributed
    systems, swarming applications face the problem that the nodes in
    a network have heterogeneous capabilities or act selfishly. We
    investigate the problem of efficient live data dissemination (e.g.,
    TV streams) in swarms. The live streams should be distributed in
    such a way that only nodes with sufficiently large contributions
    to the system are able to fully receive it---even in the presence
    of freeloading nodes or nodes that upload substantially less
    than required to sustain the multimedia stream. In contrast,
    uncooperative nodes cannot properly receive the data stream as they
    are unable to fill their data buffers in time, incentivizing a fair
    sharing of resources. If the number of selfish nodes increases, our
    emulation results reveal that the situation steadily deteriorates
    for them, while obedient nodes continue to receive virtually all

    In the field of topological self-stabilization, nodes---e.g.,
    machines in a p2p network---seek to establish a certain network
    structure in a robust manner (see, e.g., [2] for a distributed
    algorithm for skip graphs). While several complexity models have
    been proposed and analyzed over the last years, these models are
    often inappropriate to adequately model parallel efficiency: either
    they are overly pessimistic in the sense that they can force the
    algorithm to work serially, or they are too optimistic in the sense
    that contention issues are neglected. We hope that our approach will
    inspire researchers in the community to analyze other problems from

    topologies for distributed systems. While recent research has
    focused on chain topologies where nodes need to be linearized with
    respect to their identifiers, we go a step further and explore a
    natural 2-dimensional generalization. In particular, we present a
    local self-stabilizing algorithm that constructs a Delaunay graph
    from any initial connected topology and in a distributed manner.
    This algorithm terminates in time {\it O(n_3)} in the worst-case.
    We believe that such self-stabilizing Delaunay networks have
    interesting applications and give insights into the necessary
    geometric reasoning that is required for higher-dimensional

	Abstract = {Since the demise of the Overnet network, the Kad network
    has become not only the most popular but also the only widely
    used peer-to-peer system based on a distributed hash table. It is
    likely that its user base will continue to grow in numbers over the
    next few years as, unlike the eDonkey network, it does not depend
    on central servers, which increases scalability and reliability.
    Moreover, the Kad network is more efficient than unstructured
    systems such as Gnutella. However, we show that today's Kad network
    can be attacked in several ways by carrying out several (well-known)
    attacks on the Kad network. The presented attacks could be used
    either to hamper the correct functioning of the network itself,
    to censor contents, or to harm other entities in the Internet not
    participating in the Kad network such as ordinary web servers. While
    there are simple heuristics to reduce the impact of some of the
    attacks, we believe that the presented attacks cannot be thwarted
    easily in any fully decentralized peer-to-peer system without some
    kind of a centralized certification and verification authority.},

    a collection of {\it selfish} players that communicate in order to
    maximize their individual utilities. The performance of such games

    the system states in which no player can increase her utility by

    the social range matrix on the equilibria in a network game. In

	Abstract = {Peer-to-peer (p2p) computing is one of the most
    intriguing new networking paradigms of the last ten years, and many
    applications today use peer-to-peer technology, e.g. for large
    distributed computations, for file sharing, or for live media
    streaming. At the heart of the paradigm lies the idea of leveraging
    the resources of the system's participants. Thus, potentially
    scalable and robust architectures can be built.
    However, making use of the decentralized resources is challenging.
    The peers are under the control of the individual users who may only
    connect to the network for a short period of time. Consequently,
    there are frequent membership changes and p2p systems are highly
    dynamic. In addition to regular joins and leaves, the participating
    machines (often unreliable desktops) may crash. Peer-to-peer
    solutions are also faced with the fact that it is not always in
    the (anonymous) users' interest to contribute their resources.
    Rather, a user may be selfish and seek to exploit the system without
    reciprocating.
    This dissertation studies the challenges of the dynamics in p2p
    computing and of cooperation. We describe a system which is
    based on a hypercubic topology and which applies algorithms that
    maintain desirable network properties despite worst-case joins
    and leaves; these algorithms can also be used for pancake graphs.
    Besides membership dynamics, we investigate dynamic changes of
    the available bandwidth between two peers, and we analyze the
    throughput of different transfer protocols. In order to emphasize
    the importance of the cooperation challenge, we conduct a case study
    of BitTorrent--one of the most traffic intensive applications on
    the Internet--, and show that today's peer-to-peer networks still
    fail to fend off uncooperative peers. A game-theoretic analysis
    of a p2p network creation game is presented which estimates the
    impact of selfish behavior. We find that both the performance and
    the stability of a system can suffer severely. In addition, this
    dissertation introduces a mathematical framework which allows
    us to evaluate a system's robustness to malicious attacks; the
    framework is also useful for the analysis of social networks. The
    theoretic findings are complemented by a case study which identifies
    vulnerabilities in the popular Kad network.},

	Abstract = {Over the last years, game theory has provided great
    insights into the behavior of distributed systems by modeling the
    players as utility-maximizing agents. In particular, it has been
    shown that selfishness causes many systems to perform in a globally
    suboptimal fashion. Such systems are said to have a large Price of
    Anarchy. In this paper, we extend this active field of research
    by allowing some players to be malicious or Byzantine rather than
    selfish. We ask: What is the impact of Byzantine players on the
    system's efficiency compared to purely selfish environments or
    compared to the social optimum? In particular, we introduce the
    Price of Malice which captures this efficiency degradation. As an
    example, we analyze the Price of Malice of a game which models the
    containment of the spread of viruses. In this game, each node can
    choose whether or not to install anti-virus software. Then, a virus
    starts from a random node and iteratively infects all neighboring
    nodes which are not inoculated. We establish various results about
    this game. For instance, we quantify how much the presence of
    Byzantine players can deteriorate or---in case of highly risk-averse
    selfish players---improve the social welfare of the distributed

	Abstract = {Assume a set of distributed nodes which are equipped with
    a sensor device. When nodes sense an event, they want to know (the
    size of) the connected component consisting of nodes which have
    also sensed the event, in order to raise--if necessary--a disaster
    alarm. This paper presents distributed algorithms for this problem.
    Concretely, our algorithms aim at minimizing both the response time
    as well as the message complexity.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the problem of computing the most
    frequent element (the mode) by means of a distributed algorithm
    where the elements are located at the nodes of a network. Let {\it
    k} denote the number of distinct elements and further let {\it m_i}
    be the number of occurrences of the element {\it e_i} in the ordered
    list of occurrences {\it m_1>m_2>=...>=m_k}. We give a deterministic
    distributed algorithm with time complexity {\it O(D+k)} where {\it
    D} denotes the diameter of the graph, which is essentially tight. As
    our main contribution, a Monte Carlo algorithm is presented which
    computes the mode in {\it O(D + F_2/m_1^2 log k)} time with high
    probability, where the frequency moment {\it F_l} is defined as {\it
    F_l = Sum_(i=1)^k m_i^l}. This algorithm is substantially faster
    than the deterministic algorithm for various relevant frequency
    distributions. Moreover, we provide a lower bound of {\it $\Omega$(D
    + F_5/(m_1^5 B))}, where {\it B} is the maximum message size,
    that captures the eect of the frequency distribution on the time
    complexity to compute the mode.},

	Abstract = {Peer-to-peer systems rely on scalable overlay networks that enable efficient routing between its members. Hypercubic topologies facilitate such operations while each node only needs to connect to a small number of other nodes. In contrast to static communication networks, peer-to-peer networks allow nodes to adapt their neighbor set over time in order to react to join and leave events and failures. This paper shows how to maintain such networks in a robust manner. Concretely, we present a distributed and self-stabilizing algorithm that constructs a (variant of the) skip graph in polylogarithmic time from any initial state in which the overlay network is still weakly connected. This is an exponential improvement compared to previously known self-stabilizing algorithms for overlay networks. In addition, individual joins and leaves are handled locally and require little work.},

Contrary to traditional algorithmic research, faults as well as joins and leaves occurring in a worst-case manner are hardly considered. In this article, we devise techniques to build dynamic peer-to-peer systems which remain fully functional in spite of an adversary who continuously adds and removes peers. We exemplify our algorithms on hypercube and pancake topologies and present a system which maintains small peer degree and network diameter.},

  abstract     = {Modern networked systems are increasingly reconfigurable, enabling demand-aware infrastructures whose
resources can be adjusted according to the workload they currently serve. Such dynamic adjustments can be
exploited to improve network utilization and hence performance, by moving frequently interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same server or datacenter. However, dynamically changing
the embedding of workloads is algorithmically challenging: communication patterns are often not known
ahead of time, but must be learned. During the learning process, overheads related to unnecessary moves (i.e.,
re-embeddings) should be minimized. This paper studies a fundamental model which captures the tradeoff
between the benefits and costs of dynamically collocating communication partners on ? servers, in an online
manner. Our main contribution is a distributed online algorithm which is asymptotically almost optimal, i.e.,
almost matches the lower bound (also derived in this paper) on the competitive ratio of any (distributed or
centralized) online algorithm. As an application, we show that our algorithm can be used to solve a distributed
union find problem in which the sets are stored across multiple servers.},

  abstract  = {More and more networks are becoming reconfigurable: not just the routing can be programmed, but the physical
layer itself as well. Various technologies enable this programmability, ranging from optical circuit switches to beamformed
wireless connections and free-space optical interconnects.
Existing reconfigurable network topologies are typically hybrid
in nature, consisting of static and reconfigurable links. However,
even though the static and reconfigurable links form a joint
structure, routing policies are artificially segregated and hence do
not fully exploit the network resources: the state of the art is to
route large elephant flows on direct reconfigurable links, whereas
the remaining traffic is left to the static network topology. Recent
work showed that such artificial segregation is inefficient, but
did not provide the tools to actually leverage the benefits on
non-segregated routing.
In this paper, we provide several algorithms which take advantage of non-segregated routing, by jointly optimizing topology
and routing. We compare our algorithms to segregated routing
policies and also evaluate their performance in workload-driven
simulations, based on real-world traffic traces. We find that our
algorithms do not only outperform segregated routing policies,
in various settings, but also come close to the optimal solution,
computed by an integer program formulation, also presented in
this paper. Finally, we also provide insights into the complexity of
the underlying combinatorial optimization problem, by deriving
approximation hardness results.},
